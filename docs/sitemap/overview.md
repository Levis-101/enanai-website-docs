# What Is a Site Map?

A site map is a visual or written outline that displays the structure of your website. It shows the main sections, subpages, and how users can navigate from one section to another. This helps you plan content hierarchy, ensure a logical flow, and spot any missing pieces before diving into design.

For a boutique like ENANAI, the site map focuses on:
- Visual appeal
- Easy navigation
- Streamlined path from discovery to purchase or inquiry
